# BS-Notify

Program I made to notify me to measure my blood sugar every two hours. Writen in python3, for Mac OSX requiring no external libraries.

## Usage

This can be run in the background using:

```shell
python3 bsnotify.py &amp;
```

To look for the script run the `ps` command and to kill the script run `kill <ID>`.
